📘 Comic Page 4a: The Plan (Part 1)

Theme: The Ice Wizard reveals the core concept behind GUI clarity — The Elm Architecture, reimagined for Rust and visualized as a living diagram.

Layout: 4 panels (2x2 grid)
Style Notes:

    Cold, luminous blue magic now feels precise and geometric — glowing lines, crystalline arcs, shimmering runes form structured shapes midair

    Architectural diagram floats above Rusty's desk in 3D space, like a holographic spellbook

    Use glowing labels to make each part of the cycle visually clear

    Wizard becomes part teacher, part conjurer — confident, serene, precise

Panel 1 (Top Left): The Conjuring Begins

Visual: Wizard stands beside Rusty, raising his staff slightly. The tip emits light that forms glowing blue lines in the air. A rough architectural framework begins to appear midair (just geometric outlines for now). Text (Wizard): “What you need is structure — The Elm Architecture, adapted for Rust.”
Panel 2 (Top Right): Element 1 – State

Visual: The first glowing node locks into place in the diagram: a floating crystal labeled State, pulsing softly. Magical filaments anchor it in place. Text (Wizard): “Begin with your State — the single source of truth for your application.”
Panel 3 (Bottom Left): Element 2 – Messages

Visual: A second node appears, orbiting the first and connecting via a glowing arc. Labeled Messages, it emits small icon-like pulses (e.g. tap, drag, input). Text (Wizard): “Define Messages — data describing every possible user interaction.”
Panel 4 (Bottom Right): Element 3 – Update Logic

Visual: A third node locks into place. This one's labeled Update Logic, and glowing arrows from Messages feed into it. Code-like glyphs animate within. Text (Wizard): “Create Update Logic — how messages change your state.”

Color Palette:

    Cool glowing blues, subtle teal gradients

    Diagram: soft white edges with hints of circuitry or runic lines

    Background: darkened office, with light focused on diagram zone

Panel Flow Tip:
Treat this as a “summoning” sequence. Each new node builds suspense and beauty — ending in the next page (4b) with completion and Rusty's awe.
