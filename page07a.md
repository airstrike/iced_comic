Create image 📘 Page 7a: The Spell is Cast

🎯 Theme: Rusty begins implementation. Small, cold spells — iced code — take form. The counter comes alive.

Layout:

    Portrait, 3 stacked panels

    Calm, focused, confident tone

Panel 1: The Decision
Visual: Rusty, back at his desk, sleeves rolled, eyes focused. Morning light just starting to creep in.
Text (Rusty): “One step at a time…”

Panel 2: Update Logic Appears
Visual: Code flowing onto the screen — glowing softly, organized. A translucent icy overlay hints at buttons and counters taking shape behind it.

impl Counter {
  fn update(&mut self, message: Message) {
    match message {
      Message::Increment => self.value += 1,
      Message::Decrement => self.value -= 1,
    }
  }
}

Text (Narration): “Update logic — simple and clear.”

Panel 3: View Logic Emerges
Visual: Code continues forming. A stylized view() function takes shape, and behind it, the counter UI begins to crystallize from lines of code — like magic stabilizing into form.
Text (Narration): “View logic — pure and predictable.”
