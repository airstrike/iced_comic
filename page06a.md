Create image 📘 Comic Page 6a: The Path of Failure (What If…)

Theme: Rusty visualizes the nightmare scenario — what would happen if he continued without structure. The code gets messy, complexity explodes, and the team suffers.

Layout:

    Portrait format, like a full comic book page

    2–3 large panels stacked vertically

    Visual tone: redder and darker hues, stressful atmosphere, messy, overworked

Style Notes:

    Slightly dreamlike or surreal — not literal flashback, more like a dramatic vision

    Use angled, chaotic panel composition if possible (especially first and second panel)

    Code should look like a tangled mess — overlapping, hard to follow, unstructured

    Characters (Rusty, PM, team) should show increasing frustration or burnout

🎨 Image Prompt: Comic Page 6a: The Path of Failure

Panel 1: Chaotic Code Begins
Visual: Rusty’s desk as it descends into chaos. The screen shows deeply nested callbacks, global state everywhere, conflicting event handlers. Red warning/error highlights. Rusty is overwhelmed, pulling his hair or staring wide-eyed.
Text (Narration): “Without architecture…”

Panel 2: Complexity Consumes
Visual: Time passes — the code is even more tangled, like vines. New features are duct-taped into place. You might see post-its or sketches literally falling off the screen. Rusty is now surrounded by open tabs, sticky notes, debugger windows, visibly stressed.
Text (Narration): “…complexity becomes overwhelming.”

Panel 3: Failure Unfolds
Visual: A conference room scene. The project manager looks disappointed. Rusty and the team are slumped or arguing. A screen in the background shows a “DEADLINE MISSED” or “BUILD FAILED” alert.
Text (Narration): “Leading to project failure.”

Color Palette:

    Backgrounds: greys, reds, harsh shadows

    Code: red/yellow highlights (errors, warnings)

    Ambient tone: warm → hot → burned out

Tone:

    Stressful, spiraling downward

    This is a warning, a fear — Rusty seeing what could be if he takes the wrong path
