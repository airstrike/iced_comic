📘 Comic Page 5b: The First Code

Theme: Rusty begins building the counter. This page grounds us back in reality: a tired but focused developer, coding late, surrounded by mess — but now with clarity and purpose. Magic lingers only in the form of faint glows and quiet guidance.

Layout:

    Portrait format

    1 to 2 large panels max

    POV from Rusty, looking over the keyboard at the screen

    Focus is on the code and the feeling of typing something clean and powerful

🎨 Image Prompt:

A comic page in portrait layout, featuring 1–2 panels max.

Scene Description:

    Point-of-view from Rusty’s perspective at his desk, hands on keyboard, typing Rust code

    Screen shows clean editor window with glowing Rust syntax

    The code shown on screen (fully visible):

struct Counter {
    value: i64,
}

enum Message {
    Increment,
    Decrement,
}

    Surrounding environment is dim, warm-toned, lit mostly by the monitor

    The desk is cluttered: coffee cups, crumpled notes, post-its, snack wrappers

    Very faint magical glow in the periphery — maybe a soft shimmer off-screen (Wizard’s presence still nearby, but distant)

    Speech bubbles float from off-screen, styled subtly to suggest the Wizard is just out of frame:

        “Begin with your state...”
        “...and define your messages.”

Style Notes:

    Editor has dark mode (black or navy)

    Syntax highlighting is glowing but not magical — soft cyan, teal, orange

    The room feels real: slightly messy, cozy, late-night energy

    Use warm shadows and low desk lamp lighting to contrast the icy blue pages before

Tone:
This is the moment of quiet focus — the spell is broken, but the work has begun. Magic is now in the code itself.
