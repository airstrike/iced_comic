📘 Final Page (Comic Style Rework): The Glow After the Storm

🎯 Theme: A peaceful, quiet golden-hour street scene viewed from outside Rusty’s office — the spell has settled, the code is written, and the magic lingers in the air.
🎨 Revised Comic-Style Image Prompt:

A single full-page vertical panel in semi-stylized comic style — clean lines, soft shading, warm tones. No realism.

Scene Description:

    A quiet West Coast city block — small tech office buildings, a bike lane, some parked cars.

    It's sunset: a warm peach-lavender sky with golden highlights hitting the windows.

    One window of the office glows with soft blue-white light — a subtle sign of something magical still alive inside.

    Snowflakes drift slowly outside the window — visually unusual but peaceful — they don’t match the weather, but feel gently enchanted.

    Trees sway slightly; a breeze rustles a banner or a newspaper down the street.

    You might see a single person biking or walking a dog — no faces needed, just ambiance.
