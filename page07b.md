🎯 Theme: The counter grows into a real app. Rusty sees the spell work. The ice is practical now — usable.

Layout: Portrait, 2–3 panels

Panel 1: The Launch
Visual: Rusty leans back, exhausted but proud. Sunlight spills into the room. On his screen is a fully working dashboard, with counters, charts, and clean design.
Text (Narration): “Just in time…”

Panel 2: Recognition
Visual: The project manager enters, mouth open in awe. Rusty gestures to the working UI on screen.
Text (PM): “Rusty! This is incredible!”

Panel 3: Admiration
Visual: Teammates gather around the screen. Some point at the code structure, others the UI.
Text (Team): “How did you make something so complex look so simple?”
