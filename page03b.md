📘 Comic Page 3b: The Guide (Continued)

Theme: The Ice Wizard relates to Rusty’s frustration and offers the first hint of hope — that structure, not brute force, is the answer.

Visual Style Notes:

    Maintain magical lighting from Page 3a — ambient blue glow, swirling frost particles, softly falling snowflake-shaped UI glyphs

    Wizard’s presence should feel calming now — still magical, but not chaotic

    Room shows signs of magical transformation: calendar frosting slightly, code sketches glowing gently

    Emotional arc: tension dissolving → curiosity awakening

Panel 1: Shared Struggles

Visual: Wizard gesturing toward Rusty's wall calendar, with the deadline date circled in red. The calendar has frost creeping in from the corners. Rusty looks overwhelmed in the background. Text (Wizard): “Your struggles are familiar. I too once wrestled with the chaos of GUI development.”
Panel 2: Calm Reassurance

Visual: The wizard kneels or bends beside Rusty's desk, inspecting his chaotic code notes with a kind, knowing smile. Magical glyphs hover gently above the paper. Rusty watches, still stunned but listening. Text (Wizard): “You’re closer to the solution than you realize.”
Panel 3: The Shift

Visual: Close-up of Rusty’s face, eyebrows slightly lifted, a spark of realization dawning. Background dark but lit by the magical glow. Wizard’s reflection visible faintly in Rusty’s glasses. Text (Narration or Rusty's thought): “Could there really be… a better way?”

Color Palette:
Continue mystical blue/cyan, but ease off the dramatic contrast — this page is emotionally warmer and intellectually focused.

Panel Flow Tip:
Use calmer composition and spacing compared to 3a. This page is the breath after the storm — preparing for the clarity of Page 4: The Plan.
