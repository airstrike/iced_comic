📘 Updated Image Prompt: Comic Page 4b: The Plan (Part 2)

Theme: The cycle is completed — simplified for clarity — showing how State, View, and Update interact in a loop. The Ice Wizard reveals this elegant runtime-powered structure.

Layout: 4 panels (2x2 grid)
Style Notes:

    Use glowing, magical diagram elements — crystalline nodes, rune-inscribed arrows

    Keep the number of nodes minimal (3), but show how interaction flows through them

    Emphasize the looping cycle and that everything connects cleanly

    Label nodes: State, View, Update

    Add supporting glyphs: buttons/icons near View, sparks or arrows near Update

Panel 1 (Top Left): Final Element — View

Visual: Wizard gestures as the final node in the glowing diagram — View — floats into place beside State and Update. Magical threads connect the nodes.
Text (Wizard): “Finally, View turns your state into interactive widgets.”
Panel 2 (Top Right): Cycle Forms

Visual: The full cycle now appears — three glowing nodes labeled State, View, Update arranged in a triangle or loop. Animated arrows flow clockwise:
State → View → Update → State
Show UI glyphs (button, slider) emerging from View. Messages flow toward Update.
Text (Wizard): “Together, they form the fundamental cycle — powered by the runtime.”
Panel 3 (Bottom Left): Rusty's Realization

Visual: Rusty, awestruck, leans forward. His glasses reflect the spinning diagram.
Text (Rusty): “It’s so… clean.”
Panel 4 (Bottom Right): Magical Harmony

Visual: Wide shot of Rusty and the Wizard in soft blue glow. The cycle diagram gently spins above them like a magical UI core. Snowflake glyphs orbit it.
Text: (None, or optional faint whispering echo in stylized font:)
“Everything in its place.”

Color Palette:

    Same cold magical tones: glowing blue-white, cool shadows

    Use smooth arcs or light filaments to show the cycle

    Optional: draw a glowing ring or transparent dome around the full diagram labeled runtime
