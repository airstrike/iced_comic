📘 Comic Page 6c: The Choice Is Yours

Theme: We return from the imagined futures (6a/6b) to the present moment. The Ice Wizard gently disappears, leaving Rusty with the power — and responsibility — to continue the journey alone.

Layout:

    Portrait format

    3 vertical panels, evenly stacked

    Feels slow, emotional, quiet

    Start magical, end grounded

Style Notes:

    Use cool ambient blues fading to warm, grounded light as magic vanishes

    Wizard’s glow fades in stages — particles, shimmer, faint outlines

    Room returns to real-life clutter — but now it feels ready, not chaotic

🎨 Image Prompt: Comic Page 6c: The Choice Is Yours

Panel 1: The Offer Ends
Visual: The Ice Wizard stands beside Rusty, softly lit in pale blue. He smiles with quiet pride. Behind them, a faint memory of the architecture diagram still glows above the desk.
Text (Wizard): “The choice is yours. I’ve shown you the path.”

Panel 2: The Farewell
Visual: The Wizard’s form begins to dissolve into shimmering blue particles. Rusty, now standing, reaches out instinctively. The light dims slightly as the glow pulls upward.
Text (Rusty): “Wait! I have more questions!”

Panel 3: Alone, but Ready
Visual: The room is now empty — only Rusty at his desk, the chair where the wizard stood now vacant. On the desk, the crystalline Iced package still glows softly. Rusty’s face is serious, thoughtful.
Text (Narration): “The journey is yours to take.”

Color Palette:

    Panel 1: cool blues with soft magical glow

    Panel 2: more particle shimmer, fading blues

    Panel 3: warm desktop lighting with a faint icy glow from the package — grounded magic

Tone:

    Reflective, transitional

    A mentor departs, a hero steps up
