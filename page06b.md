Create image 📘 Comic Page 6b: The Path of Structure (What Could Be…)

Theme: A calm, ordered vision of successful development — structured code, a happy team, and a project delivered on time. This is Rusty imagining what could go right.

Layout:

    Portrait format, full comic book page

    2–3 tall panels stacked vertically

    Panel shapes mirror 6a for contrast, but composition should feel calm, spacious, confident

Style Notes:

    Use cool, clean tones — light blues, soft whites, subtle glows

    Office looks tidy, lit with natural light or soft screen glow

    Panels evoke focus, clarity, and quiet teamwork — clean desks, code in neat files, smiling team

    Code snippets look structured, modular, and labeled (maybe even in folders/tabs)

🎨 Image Prompt: Comic Page 6b: The Path of Structure

Panel 1: Clean Start
Visual: Rusty’s desk, same layout as 6a Panel 1, but this time tidy. The screen shows a clean struct Counter, messages enum, and function stubs, all well-commented and aligned. His face shows focus, not stress.
Text (Narration): “But with proper structure…”

Panel 2: Growing Gracefully
Visual: Same desk, but more code is added — clean components, neatly divided files, and maybe tabs open with state.rs, view.rs, etc. Visual metaphors like a glowing architectural diagram floating faintly above.
Text (Narration): “…complexity remains manageable.”

Panel 3: Team Success
Visual: The same team from 6a, but now gathered around Rusty’s screen, smiling. The PM pats him on the back. On-screen, the dashboard app is running smoothly.
Text (Narration): “Resulting in a project that delivers.”

Color Palette:

    Background: soft blues, light teals, gentle contrast

    Code: glows slightly, cyan/green/orange on dark editor

    Vibe: organized, peaceful, confident

Tone:

    Optimistic and competent

    Feels earned — not magical, just right
