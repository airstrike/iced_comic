📘 Comic Page 5a: The Call to Action (Part 1)

Theme: The Wizard offers Rusty the Iced library — a toolkit that turns theory into action. Rusty hesitates, but the Wizard grounds him in a small first step.

Layout: 4–5 panels in a smooth progression (build-up to acceptance)

Style Notes:

    Crystalline Iced package should be elegant, magical-tech: glowing facets, floating Rust logo

    Widget components look like physical, gem-like UI elements (hovering buttons, sliders, etc.)

    Maintain the cool magical palette with accents of light turquoise/gold as highlights

    Emphasize Rusty’s internal conflict (hesitation) shifting into action

🎨 Prompt for Page 5a
Panel 1: The Reminder of Struggle

Visual: Wizard gestures to Rusty’s cluttered desk — failed prototypes, crumpled sketches, messy code pages. Blue glow lights up the chaos.
Text (Wizard): “You now understand the architecture, but you need tools to implement it.”
Panel 2: The Gift

Visual: The Wizard conjures a crystalline floating package labeled “Iced”, with the Rust crab logo glowing softly inside.
Text (Wizard): “Iced implements this exact architecture in idiomatic Rust.”
Panel 3: Widgets Unleashed

Visual: The package opens, and magical UI components float above it: glowing buttons, sliders, text fields — all angular and crystalline.
Text (Wizard): “Ready-made widgets that follow Rust’s ownership rules.”
Panel 4: Doubt

Visual: Rusty hesitantly reaches out, uncertain. Light from the package glows on his face.
Text (Rusty): “But my deadline is tomorrow... Will I have time to learn this?”
Panel 5: Reassurance

Visual: Wizard gently places two glowing components (e.g., a counter icon and message glyph) in Rusty’s hands.
Text (Wizard): “Let’s build your counter first — the simplest example.”
